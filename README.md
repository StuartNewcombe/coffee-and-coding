# ONS Newport Coffee & Coding

A _public_ repository to hold resources and notes from ONS Coffee & Coding sessions in Newport. GitHub repository idea and layout lovingly sourced from [Department for Transport (DfT)'s repo](https://github.com/departmentfortransport/coffee-and-coding). Interested in what other Government Departments have coffee and coding? Check out the [Government RAP website](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap-website/resource-coffee-and-coding.html).

If you are interested in attending the London ONS Coffee and Coding please check their Github repo for more information: https://github.com/datasciencecampus/coffee-and-coding-LDN.

Get in touch at: coffee.coding@ons.gov.uk, we welcome suggestions and ideas for future events.

## Our Next Event

Our next event will be Coffee & Coding: Building a python package for reproducible statistical tables on Wed 27 May 2020, 13:00-14:00.

Good Practice Tables ([gptables](https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/gptables)) is a Python package for reproducibly writing statistical tables, which makes it easy to follow good practice guidance. This beginner-to-intermediate session will discuss why reproducibility is important and will introduce how creating and using packages can assure reproducibility in your analyses.

This event will take place via Google Hangouts, the link will be included in the confirmation email you receive when you register to attend. 

### Code Surgery

On Wednesday 27 November we ran our first hour-long drop-in Code Surgery session in the coffee shop. 
We are planning to run further Code Surgery sessions in the future, further details will be made available near the time.

This will be an opportunity to discuss any coding problems you are having, or perhaps find better ways of solving issues. Open to coders of any level or those who have not started yet and want some guidance on how to begin. 

## Contributing
Note that resources are _publicly accessible_. When adding new content work on a branch and submit a pull request.

Folders should adhere to the following conventions:

* `YYYYMMDD_Topic_Name`
* All folders should contain a `README.md` with notes or a brief explanation

## Aim
The aim of the Coffee & Coding meetups is to nurture, enable and encourage a vibrant, supportive and inclusive coding community at ONS. Coffee & Coding provides a regular opportunity for people within ONS who are interested in coding to share skills and knowledge, provide advice and guidance to each other and generally network and get to know each other. <br>The format is generally 40 minutes for a presentation and questions to the presenter/s followed by an informal Code Surgery. The presentations usually take the form of a demonstration of a tool or technique and/or a show and tell of work done within the department using these methods. From time to time we will invite external speakers. The Code Surgery provides the opportunity for people to pose any coding related queries/ruminations/ideas to the gathered coding community.

Since there is often not enough time at the end of sessions for the Code Surgery we are considering running hour-long drop-in Code Surgeries, in the coffee shop, in addition to the presentation based monthly Coffee & Coding sessions. <br>We had our first drop-in Code Surgery on Wednesday 27 November and are planning to have the second session in January.
