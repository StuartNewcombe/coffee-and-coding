# Coffee & Coding tasks

Rose Almond & Luke Shaw Summer 2019

This file is supposed to act as a guide for a few logistics on running regular coffee & coding (c&c) events at ONS Newport. It is *not* a creed, if you have just taken the c&c mantle feel free to try something different! However, we think these things have worked well in getting c&c started in ONS, so hope it will be helpful.

## Logisitics

Room booking:
* Big rooms get taken months in advance, so it's good to be ahead of the game and have at least the next 2 or 3 booked, even if you don't know who the speaker will be. Our 2 favourite rooms are R103 (booked the normal way in Outlook) and D.289 (which is booked through the Data Science Campus business support team: email datasciencecampus@ons.gov.uk)
* We advertise on Eventbrite that the sessions last an hour, but book the room for 2 hours to allow 30 mins either side for setting up & clearing away. This could be squeezed to 15 mins depending on the sessions

Coffee:
* RAS Champions (Darren Morgan) kindly funded the first 6 sessions, and the Data Science Campus the following ones. The funding is for tea & coffee and comes to roughly £50 a session.
* Each time, the email is send to datacampus@ons.gov.uk using the template in the shared inbox coffee.coding@ons.gov.uk

Presenters
* As C&C organisers you get to pick and choose the topics for events. However, you have to balance your ideas with the reality of finding someone to present. You’re not expected to be presenting every month as this requires a lot more work. It’s better to find others from business areas across ONS.

* If you’re stuck for ideas past events can be an inspiration, we’ve written a few comments on the successes/stresses of the first 8 C&C events in the shared inbox, to inspire or guide you. Usually things related to good practice or coding surgery are an easy back up.

* Coffee & Coding should aim to be useful to people with any technical ability. This doesn’t mean make the topic easy for everyone, but have elements of the session that stretch.

* We’ve tried hard to encourage any attendees to get in touch if they want to present, and make sure we are actively providing a platform for diversity – be that gender, ethnicity, or team within ONS(!).

* The RAS Roundup can be a good way of getting presenters, email Newport.RAS@ons.gov.uk to get an item added. Even further, why not post an article on Reggie about it?

* We’ve found it’s always good to meet with presenters in the week before to check that they understand what the C&C audience is likely to be, and how much time they need to allow to prepare. This is also a great moment to ask if there's anything they require from you as the organiser.


## Miscellaneous/General comments

### Advertising:

We publicise events in the following way:
* GitHub Page
* RAS RoundUp (email: newport.ras@ons.gov.uk)
* Reggie Event  (email:  News@ons.gov.uk with Eventbrite link)

### Asking for feedback:

We’ve also created a survey monkey questionnaire for feedback which can be useful if you want to give presenters feedback. It’s easy to include this in an automatic email to Eventbrite attendees.


### Blogs and Vlogs

We did a blog when C&C first got started for publicity.

## Coffee & Coding Catch-Ups

We’ve found ad-hoc catch-ups a good way of managing the workload, being able to allocate jobs and look to future tasks. We did this more frequently when we first started and less so once into the swing of it.


# Monthly Checklist
